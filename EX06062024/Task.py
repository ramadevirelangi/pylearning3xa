# In Python, the operators = and == serve very different purposes, and donâ€™t have much relation at all other than similar syntax.
# The = operator is used for assignment, such as when assigning a value to a variable.
# for x=5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
# The == operator is the relational operator for checking equality of two values.
# for x==5 checks if the value of x is equal to 5.
# If the values are the same, it will return True, and will return False.


a = int(input("enter the value:"))
if a == 5:  # = Assignment, ==condition
    print("hello")
else:
    print("bye")
